title: "Crafting a Mission Statement"
---

1.  Come up with a sentence that describes the overall mission of your organization.
2.  Get your core group together.
3.  Write down that sentence in large block letters on a piece of flip chart paper.
    Read it aloud to the group.
    Ask for feedback.
4.  Take some quiet time for everyone to think about that sentence.
    Then have each person write his or her own statement about the organization's mission.
    Write these on other pieces of flip chart paper and post them around the walls of the room.
5.  In *silence*, have all the core group members walk around the room and look at the new statements.
6.  Then sit down and discuss as a group the various statements–what you liked about this or that word,
    what each word communicates.
    You might want to break down a group of fifteen into three groups of five
    to make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak.
7.  Then see what the three groups came up with.
8.  Slowly see if you can craft a sentence that gets the agreement of everyone in the room.
